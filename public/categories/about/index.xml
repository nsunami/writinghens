      <description>Mission The mission of Grad Student Writing Group is to provide accountability for writing to survive, thrive, and publish in academia.
Meaning of &amp;ldquo;Writing&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Writing&amp;rdquo; means any activity that happens between the conception of an idea and the publication. (Definition adopted from http://www.facultydiversity.org/)
What we do  Writing Goals Check-up: We report progress of previous writing goals, reflect, and set new goals for the next week.
 Write-on-Site: We sit together in one room and write on their respective projects.</description>
