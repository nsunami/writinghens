      <description>Mission The mission of the Writing Group is to help graduate students to achieve their writing goals while maintaining a good work-life balance. We are committed to maximize productivity and quality of life of graduate students.
Meaning of &amp;ldquo;Writing&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Writing&amp;rdquo; means any activity that happens between the conception of an idea and the publication. (Definition adopted from http://www.facultydiversity.org/)
What we do  Write-on-Site: We sit together in one room and write on their respective projects.</description>
