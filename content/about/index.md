# Mission

The mission of the Writing Group is to help graduate students to achieve their writing goals while making sure that thir life comes first and work follow later. We are committed to maximize productivity and quality of life of graduate students.


# Meaning of "Writing"

"Writing" means any activity that happens between the conception of an idea and the publication. (Definition adopted from http://www.facultydiversity.org/)


# What we do

1. **Write-on-Site**: We sit together in one room and write on their respective projects.

2. **Writing Goals Check-up**: We report progress of previous writing goals, reflect, and set new goals for the next week.



# History 

The group originally started at Department of Psychological Brain Sciences in Summer 2016. It became an official graduate student organization in 2017.
