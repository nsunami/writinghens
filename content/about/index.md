### Mission

The mission of Grad Student Writing Group is to provide accountability for writing to survive, thrive, and publish in academia.


### Meaning of "Writing"

"Writing" means any activity that happens between the conception of an idea and the publication. (Definition adopted from http://www.facultydiversity.org/)


### What we do


1. **Writing Goals Check-up**: We report progress of previous writing goals, reflect, and set new goals for the next week.

2. **Write-on-Site**: We sit together in one room and write on their respective projects.


### Origin

The group originally started at Department of Psychological Brain Sciences in Summer 2016. It became an official graduate student organization in 2017.
